# Dog Object

In this example we're going to implement an object that utilizes both properties and methods.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your code editor and take a moment to example the starter code.

* Add code for `makeSound`, `sleep`, and `feed` methods on the `dog` object.

* When `makeSound` is called, the object's `sound` property should be logged to the console using the `this` keyword.

* When `sleep` is called, the object's `isSleepy` property should be set to `false`, and its `isHungry` property should be set to `true`. Use the `this` keyword to access both properties. Add a console log statement to explain to the user what's happening.

* When `feed` is called, the object's `isHungry` property should be set to `false`, and its `isSleepy` property should be set to `true`. Use the `this` keyword to access both properties. Add a console log statement to explain to the user what's happening.

* At each step remember to test your code in the console!

### Hints

* Refer back to the previous example if unsure about object methods!
