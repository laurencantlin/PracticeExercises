# DOM

In this activity we will practice querying and updating the DOM with JavaScript.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your code editor and take a moment to study the code.

* Then open the file in your web browser and notice how we are prompted for various pieces of information that correspond to the incomplete HTML being rendered to the page.

* Use the values collected by each prompt to update their corresponding element, e.g. the `name` collected from the prompt should update the element with an id of `#name`. 

* The `#name`, `#color`, and `#season` elements should be updated with the `innerText` property.

* The `#interests` element should be updated with the `innerHTML` property. For this element, use the array of interests collected and a `for-loop` to insert one `li` tag for each interest inside of the `#interest` element.

### Hints

* Have your console open ready to check for errors.

* If you are unsure about the value of a variable, print it to the console!

* Be careful about how you name your variables! It's common for code not to work due to a typo, casing matters!

* Refer to the previous example if you get stuck!
