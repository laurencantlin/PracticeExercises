# Instructor Do - Returns

* Open the slideshow and go through each slide carefully.

* Then open `return.js` and call on individual students to ask what each `console.log()` will print.

* Uncomment the `console.log()`s one at a time and show the students what is printed in the console.

* The first `console.log()` will print "sum is undefined". Ask the students why. *This is an important learning opportunity.* When a value is returned from a function, the returned value essentially replaces the function call site. When nothing is returned from a function, the function call site is replaced by the value `undefined`.

* Go through each additional `console.log()` calling on students to guess what will be logged. Be sure to point out that literals or variables can be passed as parameters.
