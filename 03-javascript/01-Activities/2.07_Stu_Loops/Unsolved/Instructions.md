# First For Loop!

* Open Sublime Text and create a new `JavaScript` file.

* In this activity we are going to create two `for loops`

    * In our first loop, count from 0 to 10 and console log each number as we go.

    * In our second loop, lets start our count FROM 10 and count to 25 and log the numbers as we go.
