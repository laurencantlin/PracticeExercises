# Arrays

* Explain to students that an `array` is a variable type which can hold multiple values within a single variable.

* Open [Arrays](Arrays.js) and explain the code inside.

    * Note that in `arrays` we must split values with a comma `,`.

* Explain that an `array` can hold multiple values of the same or different type within a single named variable and each value can be referred to using its `index`

    * `Arrays` also have a variable length, meaning you can add as many values as you want!
