# Collect User Details Solved

## Instructions

* Go over the solution to the previous activity.

* Point out how each `prompt` function returns the string collected by the user.

* Then point out the `confirm` function and demonstrate it in the browser.

  * Point out how `confirm`, like `alert`, and `prompt`, accepts a string to display in the dialog window as an argument.

  * The `confirm` function, however, returns a boolean &mdash; either `true` or `false`.

* Finally, point out the "\n" escape character inside of the `alert`. Explain that this forces the string to break to a new line.
