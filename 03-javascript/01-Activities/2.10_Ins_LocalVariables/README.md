# Parameters and Local Variables

* We just learned about function declaration and invokation and talked about `parameters`

* Explain that a `parameter` is set within a function inside the Parentheses `()` during declaration.

* Open [Parameters](Parameters.png);

* Explain that after we name our parameters we will use them in the code we want to execute &mdash; and again when we invoke

    * When we invoke, we will replace our `Parameters` with the values we would like to use

* Open [Parameters2](Parameters2.png)

* Explain that when Invoking our function, we `pass` values in which are accepted as the `parameters`

    * The function will use our passed values to evaluate the expression

* Open [Variables](Variables.js) and explain the difference between `Global` and `Local` variables

* In JavaScript we can create `Global Variables` but ALSO `Local Variables`

    * `Global Variables` are declared outside of a function while `Local Variables` are declared within a function
