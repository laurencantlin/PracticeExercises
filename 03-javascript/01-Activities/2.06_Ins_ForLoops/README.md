# For Loops over While Loops

* Explain that `while` loops are very useful when:

    * We are UNCERTAIN of the number of iterations

    * When the iteration requires a particular condition

* Explain that a `for loop` is useful when:

    * We are CERTAIN of the number of iterations we need to make

* Open [ForLoops](ForLoop.js);

    * Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).

    * Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

    * Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
