# Make a Diagram

Following the examples that we just saw, draw a diagram for the following program:

* Prompt the user to find out how many pizzas they want.

* If the number of pizzas is greater than 3 print "Here is a pizza " once for each pizza

* Otherwise print "What's wrong with you?!?"

**HINT:** You will need a while loop
