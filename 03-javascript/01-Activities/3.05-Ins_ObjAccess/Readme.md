# Object Access

* Explain that `object properties` can be accessed in 2 ways: dot notation or bracket notation.

* Dot notation is generally preferable, but bracket notation has 2 common uses:

  * When the name of the property being accessed is stored in a variable

  * When the name of the property being accessed has special characters

* Open [ObjectAccess](objectAccess.js) and explain each line making note that bracket notation only works for variables or string literals.
