# Accessing and Setting in Arryas

* Explain that we can access specific values in our `array` using its `index`.

* `Arrays` work with a `0` based index, this simply means instead of starting the count at `1` it starts at `0`.

* Explain that we can use something called bracket notation `[]` to access our `arrays` &mdash; set new values &mdash; and overwrite existing ones.

* Open [ArrayIndex](ArrayIndex.js) and explain how we can print values, add values, or change values in our array.
