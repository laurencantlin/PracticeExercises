# Events

Walk through the event files in order.


* In [event1.html](event1.html), point out that we are adding a listener to the page that listens for a key to be pressed and executes the code in the callback function when a key is pressed.

*  In [event2.html](event2.html), discuss the `event` object. Open the console, and show the class that an object called `event` was created for us and go through a few properties, making sure to show the `key` property.

*  In [event3.html](event3.html), show how we log just the `key` property of the event object.

*  In [event4.html](event4.html), demonstrate how we add logic in the callback function.
