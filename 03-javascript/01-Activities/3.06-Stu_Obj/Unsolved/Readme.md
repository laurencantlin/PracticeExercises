# Objects

Now let's make an interactive phone book:

* In the `object.html` file provided, start by adding more contacts to the `contact` object.

* `console.log` one persons phone number.

* Next add a `prompt` that prompts the user for a name and store the response in a variable called `prop`

* Use an `alert` to display the phone number associated with the name the user entered.
