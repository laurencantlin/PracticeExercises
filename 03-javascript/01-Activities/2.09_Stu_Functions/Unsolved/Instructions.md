# Our First Functions!

* Open Sublime Text and create a file named `functions.js`

* In this activity we will create 3 functions

    * Our first function will take in 1 parameter (a number) and multiply it by itself

    * Our next function will take in 2 parameters (strings) and output a full sentence

    * Our last function will take in 3 parameters (two strings and a number) and output a full sentence which includes a number

* Be sure to Invoke all of your functions after declaration and log all of your results in the console
