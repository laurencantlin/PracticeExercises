# Arrays

* Open your Sublime Text and create a new `.js` file.

* First create an array, it can be whatever you want.

* Next, lets access 2 different values from our array.

* After we have logged these values to the console, lets overwrite the 3rd element in the array.

* Finally lets add a value to the end of our array.

    * Hint: Remember the push method we used before.
