# Return

In this activity we'll make a simple e-commerce application. We'll first need to add the cost of our two items, then calculate the tax, and finally format the price before we write it to the page.

* create a function called add that returns the sum of 2 parameters

* create a function called tax that returns the total with a 7% tax added on

* First, set price equal to the return value of add(shampoo, comicBook)

* Then set price equal to the return value of tax(price)
